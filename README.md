# Personal Blog

<p>I recently (re)started a web development course and between sections I decided to get some coding in my fingers.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a personal blog, where I can easily create new posts with HTML, CSS and JS. </p>

## Sources

I didn't know how to create the pagination in JavaScript, so I followed the tutorial below and adapted it to my needs:

- [Tutsplus tutorial](<https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/pagination-with-vanilla-javascript--cms-41896> "Tutsplus tutorial")


## What I have learned

As I still have to learn a lot, it was interesting to create an own design and transforming it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a working website. What I experienced is I need a lot more practice. The most challenging part was creating the WYSIWYG editor. 

- I used [Window.getSelection()](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getSelection> "Window.getSelection()"). It was a learning process to detect which part of the contenteditable div was selectable and which not

- I learned about async function to fetch a JSON-file. But I probably did some things wrong.

- How to retrieve a query parameter in an URL

- Played a little bit with a Date object

- It is not possible to write data to a JSON-file with JavaScript only


## Things I may change in the future

- Using a technique to write my data to a JSON-file instead of copying it to the clipboard

- Adding a favicon

- When I am more experienced I think I can make it more performant in all domains: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Same as above: refactor


## Conclusion

> This is not something I would deliver to a client, but it was a great learning process
